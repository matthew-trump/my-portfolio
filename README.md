# My Portfolio --- Matthew Trump

Welcome to my Github account. Here you will find a collection of repositories for projects I've created, most of which serve as demos to document web application programming techniques I've learned while doing work for clients. I refer to these projecs when bulding new ones, and often use various components as boilerplates when creating new applications.

The projects include both front-end and back-end web software. All of the front-end projects are [Angular 2+](https://angular.io/) applications, since this is my speciality. Likewise ''most'' of the backend projects are [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) projects, since this is my minimalist tool of choice when building server apps (although I have plenty of exprience with other backend frameworks)

Many, but not all, of the projects come in pairs, that is a front-end Angular project that is designed to work specifically with a Node Express backend, and vice versa (although in many cases they could be used independently as well, in decoupled fashion).

Moreover, many of the backend node express projects contain configurations and templates for deployment of the application to various cloud platforms, including [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com), both of which I've used extensively.
